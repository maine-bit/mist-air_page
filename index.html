    <h1>Mist and Air</h1>
    <p>
      The mist, a veil that softly clings, <br>
      Drifts through the morning light like dreams.<br>
      The air, unseen yet ever near,<br>
      Whispers through the leaves, a ghostly cheer.<br>
      Though they wander the same silent paths,<br>
      They touch but never truly grasp.<br><br>

      The mist, heavy with secrets untold,<br>
      Hangs over fields, a story cold.<br>
      The air, forever light and free,<br>
      Dances around it, wild and unseen.<br>
      Their fates entwined, yet always apart,<br>
      One grounded in presence, the other in heart.<br><br>

      The mist, a fleeting, fragile breath,<br>
      Lingers on the edge of life and death.<br>
      It craves the air’s elusive form,<br>
      To hold it close, to feel its warmth.<br>
      But each attempt, though tender, fails,<br>
      As love dissolves in vapor trails.<br><br>

      And so they drift, both near and far,<br>
      Like distant echoes of a star.<br>
      Bound by fate, yet worlds apart,<br>
      Two aching halves of the same heart.<br>
      In their endless dance, we learn anew,<br>
      Some connections are felt, but never true.<br><br>

      Still, they yearn for what they’ll never know,<br>
      To merge and feel the other’s glow.<br>
      But some things in life are destined to be<br>
      Parallel forces, longing, yet free.<br>
      In their silent ballet, we see ourselves,<br>
      Two souls adrift, on different shelves.<br><br>

      In their longing, something stays,<br>
      A quiet sorrow that never decays.<br>
      For though they part, they leave behind<br>
      A trace of love, in heart and mind.<br>
